angularjs-aws-test-app
======================

AngularJS test app that works directly with DynamoDB and S3 without backend dependencies and managing the auth with AWS Fedarated Users.

Don't use it on production. This is a test app under development. Tests will be provided soon.

To use it, you need to create an Amazon App on login.amazon.com and DynamoDb table and S3 bucket on AWS, then set your credentials in the js app.
Follow this slides to use it: http://www.slideshare.net/corleycloud/javascript-cloudslideshare
